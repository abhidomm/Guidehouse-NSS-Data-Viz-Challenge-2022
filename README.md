Our project visualizes the Yearbook of Immigration Statistics sourced from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through a Tableau Story. We focused on methods to recognize trending immigrant movement from significant countries to the United States. The primary data identifies an overall profile of the immigrant, and the supplemental data from the Census Bureau provides information to the current foreign-born population. Additionally, we pulled foreign direct investment (FDI) data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), immigrant median household income from the Pew Research Center, and International Migration Trends from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). As immigration is continually dynamic and multi-faceted, our visualization aims to provide an understanding of global activity for national population changes and anticipate a growing forecast of individuals seeking a home in the United States.
